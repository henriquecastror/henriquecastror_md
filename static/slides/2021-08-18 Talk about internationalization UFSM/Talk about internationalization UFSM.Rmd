**I am a young scholar. What the H do I know?**

# The current state

**Too many** articles...

--

... in **low-quality** journals.

--

**Scholars are  doing their best**

  - To get "tenure" (not a common concept in Brazil yet)
  - To increase reputation
  - High competitive environment (mental health is a problem)
  
  
--

**Journals are doing their best to increase impact**

  - Game of metrics
  - High competitive environment for journals

# Too many articles

# International Standards

**ABS List** ([Site](https://charteredabs.org/academic-journal-guide-2021/))
  
  - A short (messy!) [list](https://henriquecastror-book-of-notes.netlify.app/journals-rankings.html).
  
--

**Focus is on**:
  - **ABS 4* ** (too competitive)
  - **ABS 4** (highly competitive)
  - **ABS 3** (competitive)
  - _ABS 2_ (there are good journals here)
  - _ABS 1_ (there might be a few good journals here)

  

--

_An international ranking list has several advantages over a national one_.

# International movements

**Open science**

" _Open science encompasses unhindered access to scientific articles, **access to data from public research**, and **collaborative research** enabled by ICT tools and incentives._ 

_Broadening access to scientific publications and data is at the heart of open science, so that research outputs are in **the hands of as many as possible**, and potential benefits are **spread as widely as possible**_" ([OCDE](https://www.oecd.org/science/inno/open-science.htm)).

**É um movimento internacional, já presente em vários campos de pesquisa, com o objetivo de tornar a pesquisa acadêmica mais transparente, acessível e relevante.**

# International movements

**Open science**

  - **Open code**
  
  - **Open data**
  
  - **Open peer review**
  
  - Data **repositories**
      - **Need data?** Mendeley data, Dataverse, Data in Brief, ...

# Networks & Conferences

**I could not stress more** the importance of network, international contacts, and international co-authors...

- Many **relationships** are established during a conference
  - Pay attention to how many accents are there in a conference

--

- Best way to understand what is the **current game**
  - For instance, Finance: **Causal Inference Methods**

--

- Every section gives, at least, **one good idea** (and many bad ones)
--

- Pay attention to the **questions that senior scholars make**
  
  - They know better than you, if they don't know the answer, it is always nice to provide one (if possible)
  - Plus, your article will likely have an international audience

# Papers about writing papers

1) Shepherd DA, Wiklund J. Simple Rules, Templates, and Heuristics! An Attempt to Deconstruct the Craft of Writing an Entrepreneurship Paper. Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice. 2020;44(3):371-390. https://doi:10.1177/1042258719845888

  - Part II, Part III, ...

# For Students

**If you are playing the quantity game, you are playing it wrong, in my opinion**.

--

  - Focus on quality, your whole 40-year career is a 20-ABS3 papers, not a 200+ papers

--

  - Understand the concept of a **Job Market Paper**
    - Doesn't need to be published by the end of your PhD, but senior enough to nice presentations 
    - Without one, your chances are lower.

--

  - Create a **single project**
    - You, yourself, and you alone
    - It shows that you execute all parts of a project
    - Also, helps to understand how to be a better tutor in the future
    - Your supervisor, better than anyone, will understand

--

  - Spend time on the **letter**
    - sometimes, the response **letter has more pages** than the article







---

# For Faculty

**The major output a professor can have is the positions their students get.**

  - Students are **future co-authors** 
      - Likely they'll know the literature better
  
  - The best articles, most likely, come **during your career**, not during the PhD of your student.
  
  - Brazilian standards need to change from a short-term (i.e., 4 years students) **to a long-term mindset** (i.e., relationship with the student and future outcomes).
      - Helps thinking more about quality than quantity.

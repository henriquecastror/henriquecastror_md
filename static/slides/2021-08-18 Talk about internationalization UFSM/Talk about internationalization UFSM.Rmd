# The current state

**Too many** articles...

--

... in **low-quality** journals.

--

**Scholars are  doing their best**

  - To get "tenure" (not a common concept in Brazil yet)
  - To increase reputation
  - High competitive environment (mental health is a problem)
  
  
--

**Journals are doing their best to increase impact**

  - Game of metrics
  - High competitive environment for journals

# International Standards

**ABS List**

  - [Site](https://charteredabs.org/academic-journal-guide-2021/)
  
  - A short (messy!) [list](https://henriquecastror-book-of-notes.netlify.app/journals-rankings.html).

Focus is
  - ABS 4* (too competitive)
  - ABS 4

# For Faculty

**The major output a professor can have is the positions their students get.**

  - Students are **future co-authors** 
      - likely more updated literature background
  
  - The best articles, most likely, come **during your career**, not during the PhD of your student.
  
  - Brazilian standards need to change from a short-term (i.e., 4 years students) **to a long-term mindset** (i.e., relationship with student and future outcomes).
      - Helps thinking more about quality than quantity.

# The challenge


`$$\\[1cm]$$`

- I will discuss some issues in using  plain OLS models in Corporate Finance &amp; Governance Research

--

- I will avoid the word ‚Äúendogeneity‚Äù as much as I can

--

- I will also avoid the word ‚Äúidentification‚Äù because identification does not guarantee causality and vice-versa (Kahn and Whited 2017)

--

- The discussion is based on [Atanasov and Black (2016)](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/CFR-0036)

# The challenge


`$$\\[0.75cm]$$`

- Imagine that you want to investigate the effect of Governance on Q

    - You may have more covariates explaining Q (omitted  from slides)
    
`$$\\[0.2cm]$$`

 `\(ùë∏_{i} = Œ± + ùú∑_{i} √ó Gov + Controls + error\)`



`$$\\[0.2cm]$$`

--

 All the issues in next slides will make it not possible to infer that __changing Gov will _CAUSE_ a change in Q__ 
 
 That is, cannot infer causality

# 1) Reverse causation

`$$\\[0.75cm]$$`

_One source of bias is: reverse causation_

- Perhaps it is Q that causes Gov

- OLS based methods do not tell the difference between these two betas:

`$$\\[0.2cm]$$`

`\(ùëÑ_{i} = Œ± + ùú∑_{i} √ó Gov + Controls + error\)`

`\(Gov_{i} = Œ± + ùú∑_{i} √ó Q + Controls + error\)`

`$$\\[0.2cm]$$`

- If one Beta is significant, the other will most likely be significant too

- You need a sound theory!

# 2) Omitted variable bias (OVB)


_The second source of bias is: OVB_

- Imagine that you do not include an important ‚Äútrue‚Äù predictor of Q

- Let's say, long is:  `\(ùë∏_{i} = ùú∂_{long} + ùú∑_{long}* gov_{i} + Œ¥ * omitted + error\)`

- But you estimate short:  `\(ùë∏_{i} = ùú∂_{short} + ùú∑_{short}* gov_{i} + error\)`

- `\(ùú∑_{short}\)` will be: 

    - `\(ùú∑_{short} = ùú∑_{long}\)` +  relationship between omitted (omitted) and included (Gov) * effect of omitted in long (Œ¥)

        - Where: relationship between omitted (omitted) and included (Gov) is: `\(Omitted = ùú∂ + œï *gov_{i} + u\)`

- Thus, OVB is: `\(ùú∑_{short} ‚Äì ùú∑_{long} = œï * Œ¥\)`

- See an example in r [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Il68vTUI5I)











---

# 3) Specification error

`$$\\[0.75cm]$$`

_The third source of bias is: Specification error_

- Even if we could perfectly measure gov and all relevant covariates, we would not know for sure the functional form through which each influences q

    - Functional form: linear? Quadratic? Log-log? Semi-log?

- Misspecification of x‚Äôs is similar to OVB

- Poor specification leads to bias








---

# 4) Signaling

`$$\\[0.75cm]$$`

_The fourth source of bias is: Signaling_

- Perhaps, some individuals are signaling the existence of an X without truly having it:

    - For instance: firms signaling they have good governance without having it

- This is similar to the OVB because you cannot observe the full story









---

# 5) Simultaneity


`$$\\[0.75cm]$$`

_The fifth source of bias is: Simultaneity_

- Perhaps gov and some other variable x are determined simultaneously

- Perhaps there is bidirectional causation, with q causing gov and gov also causing q 

- In both cases, OLS regression will provide a biased estimate of the effect

- Also, the sign might be wrong










---

# 6) Heterogeneous effects

`$$\\[0.75cm]$$`

_The sixth source of bias is: Heterogeneous effects_

- Maybe the causal effect of gov on q depends on observed and unobserved firm characteristics:

    - Let's assume that firms seek to maximize q
    - Different firms have different optimal gov
    - Firms know their optimal gov
    - If we observed all factors that affect q, each firm would be at its own optimum and OLS regression would give a non-significant coefficient


- In such case, we may find a positive or negative relationship.

- Neither is the true causal relationship





---

# 7) Construct validity

`$$\\[0.75cm]$$`

_The seventh source of bias is: Construct validity_

- Some constructs (e.g. Corporate governance) are complex, and sometimes have conflicting mechanisms

- We usually don‚Äôt know for sure what ‚Äúgood‚Äù governance is, for instance

- It is common that we use imperfect proxies

- They may poorly fit the underlying concept







---

# 8) Measurement error


`$$\\[0.4cm]$$`

_The eighth source of bias is: Measurement error_


- "Classical" measurement error for the outcome will inflate standard errors but will not lead to biased coefficients. 

    - `\(y^{*} = y + \sigma_{1}\)`
    - If you estimante `\(y^{*} = f(x)\)`, you have `\(y + \sigma_{1} = x + \epsilon\)` 
    - `\(y = x + u\)` 
        - where `\(u = \epsilon + \sigma_{1}\)` 

- "Classical" random measurement error in x‚Äôs will bias coefficient estimates toward zero

    - `\(x^{*} = x + \sigma_{2}\)`
    - Imagine that `\(x^{*}\)` is a bunch of noise
    - It would not explain anything
    - Thus, your results are biased toward zero

---

# 9) Observation bias


`$$\\[0.75cm]$$`

_The ninth source of bias is: Observation bias_


- This is analogous to the Hawthorne effect, in which observed subjects behave differently because they are observed

- Firms which change gov may behave differently because their managers or employees think the change in gov matters, when in fact it has no direct effect

---



# 10) Interdependent effects


`$$\\[0.75cm]$$`

_The tenth source of bias is: Interdependent effects_


- Imagine that a governance reform that will not affect share prices for a single firm might be effective if several firms adopt

- Conversely, a reform that improves efficiency for a single firm might not improve profitability if adopted widely because the gains will be competed away

- "one swallow doesn't make a summer" 




---



# 11) Selection bias


`$$\\[0.75cm]$$`

_The eleventh source of bias is: Selection bias_


- If you run a regression with two types of companies

    - High gov (let's say they are treated)
    - Low gov (let's say they are control)
    
    
- Without any matching method, these companies are likely not comparable

- Thus, the estimated beta will contain selection bias

- The bias can be either be positive or negative

- It is similar to OVB


  
---



# 12) Self-Selection


`$$\\[0.75cm]$$`

_The twelfth source of bias is: Self-Selection_


- Self-selection is a type of selection bias

- Usually, firms decide which level of governance they adopt

- There are reasons why firms adopt high governance

    - If observable, you need to control for
    - If unobservable, you have a problem

- It is like they "self-select" into the treatment 

    - Units decide whether they receive the treatment of not

- Your coefficients will be biased

# ICGS Editors Tips


$$\\[1cm]$$

I will share in these slides the notes I took from the two panels with A-Journals at the International Corporate Governance Society Annual Meeting.

I hope you like it!

# Tip 1: Never omit references


Editors know the literature so well. If you are omitting important references, editors will notice it.

# Tip 2: Introduction is the main part

Introduction is where reviewers decide whether they like or not your article.

Introduction is about 10% of the lenght of a paper, but you should work 25% of your time on it.

# Tip 2: Abstract needs to be crystal-clear

Abstract is always the only part that reviewers and editors always fully read.

So, it needs to be as clear as possible.

And it needs to deliver your message right away.

# Tip 3: Focus on the contribution

The single most important factor to get published is to provide a contribution.

Contribution is subjective, but editors and reviewers can always smell if you don't have one.

# Tip 2: 90% persistence, 10% I.Q.

Publishing is about 90% persistence. The remaining 10% is about being smart.

# 2) Omitted variable bias (OVB)

_The second source of bias is: OVB_

- Imagine that you do not include an important “true” predictor of Q

- Let's say, long is:  $𝑸_{i} = 𝜶_{long} + 𝜷_{long}* gov_{i} + δ * omitted + error$

- But you estimate short:  $𝑸_{i} = 𝜶_{short} + 𝜷_{short}* gov_{i} + error$

- $𝜷_{short}$ will be: 

    - $𝜷_{short} = 𝜷_{long}$ +  bias

    - $𝜷_{short} = 𝜷_{long}$ +  relationship between omitted (omitted) and included (Gov) * effect of omitted in long (δ)

        - Where: relationship between omitted (omitted) and included (Gov) is: $Omitted = 𝜶 + ϕ *gov_{i} + u$

- Thus, OVB is: $𝜷_{short} – 𝜷_{long} = ϕ * δ$

- See an example in r [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Il68vTUI5I)

# 3) Specification error

$$\\[0.75cm]$$

_The third source of bias is: Specification error_

- Even if we could perfectly measure gov and all relevant covariates, we would not know for sure the functional form through which each influences q

    - Functional form: linear? Quadratic? Log-log? Semi-log?

- Misspecification of x’s is similar to OVB








---

# 4) Signaling

$$\\[0.75cm]$$

_The fourth source of bias is: Signaling_

- Perhaps, some individuals are signaling the existence of an X without truly having it:

    - For instance: firms signaling they have good governance without having it

- This is similar to the OVB because you cannot observe the full story









---

# 5) Simultaneity


$$\\[0.75cm]$$

_The fifth source of bias is: Simultaneity_

- Perhaps gov and some other variable x are determined simultaneously

- Perhaps there is bidirectional causation, with q causing gov and gov also causing q 

- In both cases, OLS regression will provide a biased estimate of the effect

- Also, the sign might be wrong










---

# 6) Heterogeneous effects

$$\\[0.75cm]$$

_The sixth source of bias is: Heterogeneous effects_

- Maybe the causal effect of gov on q depends on observed and unobserved firm characteristics:

    - Let's assume that firms seek to maximize q
    - Different firms have different optimal gov
    - Firms know their optimal gov
    - If we observed all factors that affect q, each firm would be at its own optimum and OLS regression would give a non-significant coefficient


- In such case, we may find a positive or negative relationship.

- Neither is the true causal relationship





---

# 7) Construct validity

$$\\[0.75cm]$$

_The seventh source of bias is: Construct validity_

- Some constructs (e.g. Corporate governance) are complex, and sometimes have conflicting mechanisms

- We usually don’t know for sure what “good” governance is, for instance

- It is common that we use imperfect proxies

- They may poorly fit the underlying concept







---

# 8) Measurement error


$$\\[0.3cm]$$

_The eighth source of bias is: Measurement error_


- "Classical" random measurement error for the outcome will inflate standard errors but will not lead to biased coefficients. 

    - $y^{*} = y + \sigma_{1}$
    - If you estimante $y^{*} = f(x)$, you have $y + \sigma_{1} = x + \epsilon$ 
    - $y = x + u$ 
        - where $u = \epsilon + \sigma_{1}$ 

- "Classical" random measurement error in x’s will bias coefficient estimates toward zero

    - $x^{*} = x + \sigma_{2}$
    - Imagine that $x^{*}$ is a bunch of noise
    - It would not explain anything
    - Thus, your results are biased toward zero

# 9) Observation bias


$$\\[0.75cm]$$

_The ninth source of bias is: Observation bias_


- This is analogous to the Hawthorne effect, in which observed subjects behave differently because they are observed

- Firms which change gov may behave differently because their managers or employees think the change in gov matters, when in fact it has no direct effect

# 10) Interdependent effects


$$\\[0.75cm]$$

_The tenth source of bias is: Interdependent effects_


- Imagine that a governance reform that will not affect share prices for a single firm might be effective if several firms adopt

- Conversely, a reform that improves efficiency for a single firm might not improve profitability if adopted widely because the gains will be competed away

- "One swallow doesn't make a summer" 




---



# 11) Selection bias


$$\\[0.75cm]$$

_The eleventh source of bias is: Selection bias_


- If you run a regression with two types of companies

    - High gov (let's say they are the treated group)
    - Low gov (let's say they are the control group)
    
    
- Without any matching method, these companies are likely not comparable

- Thus, the estimated beta will contain selection bias

- The bias can be either be positive or negative

- It is similar to OVB


  
---



# 12) Self-Selection


$$\\[0.75cm]$$

_The twelfth source of bias is: Self-Selection_


- Self-selection is a type of selection bias

- Usually, firms decide which level of governance they adopt

- There are reasons why firms adopt high governance

    - If observable, you need to control for
    - If unobservable, you have a problem

- It is like they "self-select" into the treatment 

    - Units decide whether they receive the treatment of not

- Your coefficients will be biased

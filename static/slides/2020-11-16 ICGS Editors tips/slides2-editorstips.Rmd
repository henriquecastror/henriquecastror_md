# ICGS Editors' Tips


$$\\[1cm]$$

I will share in these slides the notes I took from the two panels with editors from A-Journals at the [**International Corporate Governance Society (ICGS)**](https://icgsociety.org/) Annual Meeting.

I hope you like it!

# Tip 1: Learn to receive feedback

**This is the most important tip.** 

When we get a rejection, we usually get frustrated. Learning to receive negative feedback to work on your weakness is super important to succeed in your career.

# Tip 2: Never omit references


Editors know the literature so well. If you are omitting essential references, they will notice it.

# Tip 3: You need a story

It doesn't matter if you have the perfect empirical design or the nicest dataset; if you do not have a story to tell, you are in trouble.

**Learn to create and to tell your story.**

# Tip 4: Introduction is the main part

The introduction is where reviewers decide whether they like or not your article.

The introduction is about 10% of the paper's length, but you should work **25% of your time** on it.

# Tip 5: Abstract needs to be crystal-clear

The abstract is always the only part that reviewers and editors always thoroughly read.

So, it needs to be as clear as possible.

And it needs to **deliver the message right away**.

# Tip 6: Focus on the contribution

The most critical factor in getting published is to **have a contribution**.

The definition of contribution is subjective, but editors and reviewers can always smell if you don't have one.

# Tip 7: Understand the journal

You have to **understand the journal**, the scope, and the past articles in there.

If you are not familiar with the journal's characteristics, you have less chance.

# Tip 8: Don't do papers, Do projects

If you have an **established and well-thought project where you get excited** every day, your chances of success are high.

If you only do papers for the sake of doing it, you'll get frustrated eventually.

# Tip 9: Explore the context

You always have to explore the context of your sample and/or dataset.

Providing new results of an established topic is ok...

...but **exploring your context to provide new insights** is better.

# Tip 10: 90% persistence, 10% I.Q.

Publishing is about **90% persistence**. 

The remaining 10% is about being smart.

# Tip 11: Letters matter

Authors sometimes do not pay attention to the cover letter or to response letters to reviewers. 

But letters matter. And they matter a lot.

**Learn how to write good letters**. And be honest in them. Don't try to oversell your article; editors smell such things.



---

class: left

# Tip 12: Editors want to publish

Finally, remember that no editor is blocking you. 

They want to publish articles. But they want to publish **good** articles. 

You have to do your job of getting and submitting a good one.

title: Global Index of Peace

subtitle: Did you know about this index?

---

Did you know there is a Global Index of Peace? I certainly didn't. 

Apparently, the [**Institute for Economics & Peace**](https://www.economicsandpeace.org/) measures peace in almost all countries since 2014.

Brazil is not doing well in this ranking. We are at position **126** in the 2020 report (see the report [here](https://www.economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GPI_2020_web.pdf) or [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4127329)). We lost three positions since 2019.

The report suggests the problem of Brazil is not domestic nor international conflict. It is societal safety and security. I agree!

There is something else: the report estimates that the Economic Cost of Violence is around 10% of Brazilian GDP. UAU!

Some countries that caught my attention by their position:

- Portugal: 3rd (Seems pretty good.)
- Hungary: 24th (Aren't they under a dictatorship in 2020?)
- Uruguay: 35th (Cool!)
- France: 66th (Not a good position for an important country as France.)
- United States of America: 121th (It doesn't look right!)

Thanks for passing by!

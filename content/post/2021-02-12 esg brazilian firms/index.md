title: Evolution of Brazilian Companies ESG Score

---

I am working on a research project that aims to understand the antecedents and consequences of Corporate ESG. 

Eventually, I came up with the graph below. 


{{< figure src="Graph1.png" width="100%" >}}

This graph did not make much sense to me since ESG is a hot topic and, I believe, no one would expect that Brazilian firms decreased ESG practices and disclosure over the last decade. "Something is wrong", I thought!

Then, I realized that the sample of firms is different each year because some firms started to disclose ESG practices **during** the last decade. Basically, the number of firms disclosing in 2019 was 84, while in 2010 was 51. 

I'd expect that a firm that recently started to disclose would get a lower score than a firm that has been implementing it for a while. Thus, the average of all firms may be decreasing over time. 

Then, I came up with this graph. It only contains firms that are disclosing ESG practices since 2010. In this graph, I have the same sample of firms in all years. 
The sample is smaller, but it is much more informative if I want to understand the evolution of corporate ESG during this period.

See the difference? 


I hope you like it!

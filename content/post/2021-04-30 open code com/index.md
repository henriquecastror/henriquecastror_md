Hey, check out my new project about open code. 

We launched a website where everyone can share their own codes. It is all open, accessible, and free.

Check the website [here](https://opencodecom.net/).

I am thrilled to launch this project. If you like the type of codes I used to share here, please stay tuned.

I hope it helps you!

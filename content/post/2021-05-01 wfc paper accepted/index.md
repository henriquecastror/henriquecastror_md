Yeah, I had paper accepted to be presented at the [World Finance Conference](https://www.world-finance-conference.com/conference.php?id=21).


The article title is _"Competition and ESG practices in emerging markets: evidence from a differences-in-differences model"_ and is part of my ESG projects. 

Happy to share the news!

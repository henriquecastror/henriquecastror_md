## Data Reuse

One of the most critical tasks of executing empirical research in Business Administration is to collect reliable data. This is usually costly, time-consuming and, sometimes, demands legal agreements to guarantee the rights of those who own the data. Thus, the  access to empirical data is of extreme value for researchers of several fields.

One of the pillars of *Open Science* is Data Reuse. To foster Data Reuse [Marcelo S. Perlin](https://www.msperlin.com/blog/) and I are inviting subbimissions to the [Journal of Contemporary Administration (RAC)](rac.anpad.org.br).

title: RAC's special issue of tutorial-articles

---

I am so happy to share that the special issue of tutorial-articles has been published by RAC - Journal of Contemporary Administration. It is the v. 25 n. 1 (2021): Jan/Fev - 2021 (Special Issue) of RAC.

You can download all tutorial-articles [here](https://rac.anpad.org.br/index.php/rac). 

I am quite sure you'd love to know that all articles have open data and open code. You can use them all to learn a great deal about empirical methods.

I thank the EIC, [Wesley Mendes](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4777646J1), for the opportunity of working on this issue.

I also thank all authors that contributed to this issue and the work of all reviewers.

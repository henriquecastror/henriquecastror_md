We just received the news that a paper was accepted to presentation at the 6th annual International Corporate Governance Society ([ICGS](https://icgsociety.org/)) conference to be held November 14 - 16, 2020.

This paper is the first of [Marcio Pimenta](http://lattes.cnpq.br/1670868214172308)'s thesis. Good job, Marcio!

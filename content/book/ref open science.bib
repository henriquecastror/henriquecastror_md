abstract = {Corroboration of empirical insights is critical to theory development, developing generalizations from empirical findings, verifying the validity and reliability of findings, delimiting the scope of empirical findings, and increasing scientific rigor. Despite the widely acknowledged role of replication, corroboration, and synthetization in building scientific knowledge, few elite and top tier marketing and business journals seriously consider for publication papers attempting to reproduce the empirical insights of previously published studies. Consequently, a majority of the top marketing peer-review literature consists mainly of single research endeavors or multiple intra-studies within a single main study (or series of studies) with the result being that the published evidence is built largely on unverified and potentially tenuous findings. This special issue of the Journal of Business Research consists of thirteen articles that use different types of replication research procedures to independently attempt to corroborate previously reported marketing studies that display evidence of representing significant, relevant, theoretical and managerial contributions. We offer introspection on how corroboration fits with other movements in the statistical community to promote a better literature.},

abstract = {Recent debates on transparency and replicability suggest that JIBS needs to update its approach on data access and research transparency (DART). We propose a series of initiatives, knowing well that there is a balance to be struck. There are clear benefits on the one hand, chief among these the potential for learning and knowledge accumulation, and equally manifest challenges on the other: the imperative to respect privacy, confidentiality, and intellectual property rights. Without addressing these challenges, will there be the high-quality data on which the benefits depend? We present access and transparency objectives, and set out how an actionable and effective approach towards DART will be implemented, but also address ethical, legal, and organizational challenges of concern to us as a scholarly community.},

@article{Harvey2017,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: Given the competition for top journal space, there is an incentive to produce “significant” results. With the combination of unreported tests, lack of adjustment for multiple tests, and direct and indirect p-hacking, many of the results being published will fail to hold up in the future. In addition, there are basic issues with the interpretation of statistical significance. Increasing thresholds may be necessary, but still may not be sufficient: if the effect being studied is rare, even t {\textgreater} 3 will produce a large number of false positives. Here I explore the meaning and limitations of a p-value. I offer a simple alternative (the minimum Bayes factor). I present guidelines for a robust, transparent research culture in financial economics. Finally, I offer some thoughts on the importance of risk-taking (from the perspective of authors and editors) to advance our field. SUMMARY: Empirical research in financial economics relies too much on p-values, which are poorly understood in the first place. Journals want to publish papers with positive results and this incentivizes researchers to engage in data mining and “p-hacking.” The outcome will likely be an embarrassing number of false positives—effects that will not be repeated in the future. The minimum Bayes factor (which is a function of the p-value) combined with prior odds provides a simple solution that can be reported alongside the usual p-value. The Bayesianized p-value answers the question: What is the probability that the null is true? The same technique can be used to answer: What threshold of t-statistic do I need so that there is only a 5{\%} chance that the null is true? The threshold depends on the economic plausibility of the hypothesis.},

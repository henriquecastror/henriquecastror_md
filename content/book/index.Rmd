# Book of notes

This is a collection of random notes that I am continually updating using **Markdown**.

The primary purpose is to make online stuff that is important in my **classes**, **projects**, or **articles**.

You may consult here searching for **references**, **project ideas**, and some **codes** that I used eventually.

You may consult a bunch of other stuff in https://henriquemartins.net/. 

I hope you find it **useful**. Thanks for passing by!

> **Ps: Vou misturar Português e Inglês. Some notes are in English, others in Portuguese.**

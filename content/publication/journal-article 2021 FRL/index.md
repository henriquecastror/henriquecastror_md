*Abstract:*

This paper investigates how competition affects firms' environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices in 22 emerging markets, using a sample of 6,906 firm-year observations from 2011 to 2019. Using a difference-in-differences technique and matched samples with a treated and a control group, I explore exogenous variation in the competitive environment of one country, Brazil, to assess the competition´s causal effect on ESG. The results suggest that firms adjust ESG practices negatively after a shock in competition, contrasting with previous results from developed economies.

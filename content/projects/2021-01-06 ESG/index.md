### First project about ESG: the effects of market competition 

This paper investigates how competition affects corporate environmental, social, and governance practices (ESG) in 22 emerging markets using a sample of 5.971 firm-year observations from 2011 to 2019. Using a differences-in-differences technique and matched samples from a treated vs. control group configuration, I explore exogenous variation in one country's competitive environment (i.e., Brazil) to assess the causal effect from competition to ESG. The results suggest that firms adjust ESG practices negatively after a competition shock, which contrasts with previous results from developed economies.

We are a group of programming and Open Science enthusiasts aiming to share codes for the entire community. Our goal is to help students and professionals with the development of their codes and analyses. If you are willing to contribute to this project, share your code.

If you are looking for research ideas and how to execute them, check the [website](https://opencodecom.net/).
